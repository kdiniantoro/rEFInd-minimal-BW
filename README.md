## rEFInd-minimal, black & white edition

[rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a simple boot manager for UEFI-based systems. This is a clean and minimal theme for it.

### Usage

 1. Locate your rEFInd EFI directory. This is commonly `/boot/EFI/refind`,
    though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is
    installed. `fdisk -l` and `mount` may help.

 2. Clone this repository into your rEFInd configuration directory.

 3. To enable the theme add `include rEFInd-minimal-BW/theme.conf` at the end of
    `refind.conf`.

Here's an example menuentry configuration:

```nginx
menuentry "Arch Linux" {
	icon /EFI/refind/rEFInd-minimal-BW/icons/os_arch.png
	loader vmlinuz-linux
	initrd initramfs-linux.img
	options "rw root=UUID=dfb2919d-ff78-48db-a8a7-23f7542c343a loglevel=3"
}

menuentry "Windows" {
	icon /EFI/refind/rEFInd-minimal-BW/icons/os_win.png
	loader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}

menuentry "OSX" {
	icon /EFI/refind/rEFInd-minimal-BW/icons/os_mac.png
	loader /EFI/Apple/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}
```

Entries that are autodetected should also show the proper icons.

### Attribution

This theme is based on the [rEFInd-minimal][rEFInd-minimal] theme by [EvanPurkhiser][EvanPurkhiser].

Most of the OS icons are from [Lightness for burg][icons] by [SWOriginal][icon-author]; they were modified to match the black background of this theme.

The Windows icon is from the [rEFInd Next][rEFInd-Next] theme by [sdbinwiiexe][sdbinwiiexe]; it was scaled and aligned to the selection icons in this theme.
